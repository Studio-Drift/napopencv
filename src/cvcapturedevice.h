	 * This device captures OpenCV frames in a background thread. 
	 * Add an adapter to the 'Adapters' property to capture a frame from that specific device. Multiple adapters can be specified.
	 * Every frame from every adapter is captured at the exact same point in time, allowing for perfect frame capture synchronization.
	 * 
	 * To receive frame events on the main thread use a nap::CVCaptureComponent and listen to the 'frameReceived' signal.
	 * Frames are automatically forwarded to the right component based on the nap::CVCaptureComponent 'Device' property.
	 * Listen to the 'frameCaptured' signal of this device to receive new frame events from the processing (background) thread directly.
	 *
	 * Internally this device keeps track of all eligible adapters for capture. 
	 * If an adapter can't be opened on start(), the adapter is not added as a source for capture.
	 * When during capture an adapter disconnects or fails to grab a frame, it is closed automatically if the adapter's 'CloseOnError' flag is set.
